# Analysis of the Agricultural Dataset using Plotly

The code include a detail analysis of the data taken from the open source website Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arifmia/agricultural-land-suitability-and-soil-quality?resource=download).  
Following is the structure of the code. 

# 1. Data Loading and Preparation:

Imported libraries such as Plotly, Pandas, and NumPy.  
Loaded a dataset named bangladesh_divisions_dataset.csv.  
Conducted initial data inspection (head, info, describe).  
Handled null and duplicate values.  
Renamed columns for consistency. 

# 2. Data Exploration:  

Extracted unique locations and other dataset characteristics.    

# 3. Visualizations:

Bar plot for soil type counts across locations.  
Pie chart for proportions of land use types.  
Histogram for the distribution of fertility index, rainfall, and temperature.    
Scatter plots for relationships like rainfall vs. temperature and fertility index vs. rainfall.  
Box plots and violin plots for temperature distributions across seasons and soil types.  
Sunburst plot for hierarchical relationships among soil types, land use, and crop suitability.  
Correlation matrix and scatter matrix for numerical features.  
3D scatter plot of fertility index, rainfall, and temperature.  

# 4. Analysis:
Explored correlations among features.  
Analyzed relationships using groupings and visualizations.
